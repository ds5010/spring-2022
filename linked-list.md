## Linked list definition

* A linked list is a "linear" collection of elements whose order is not related to their physical location in memory
* It is a data structure consisting of a collection of "nodes" which together represent a "sequence"
* Each node contains data and a "reference" (i.e., a "link") to the next node in the sequence.
* The structure allows efficient insertion and removal of elements during iteration for any position in the sequence.
* Benefit:
  * unlike arrays, element insertion and removal doesn't require reallocation or reorganization of the entire structure
* Drawbacks: 
  * access time is linear
  * random access is not possible
  * arrays have better "cache locality"

## Array

* a data structure consisting of a collection of elements identified by at least one array index or key
* each elements position can be computed from its index "tuple" by a mathematical formula
* the simplest type of array is a linear (i.e, one-dimensional) array
