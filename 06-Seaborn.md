  * Scatterplot -- reproduce final scatterplot created in class (arguably demonstrates vaccine effectiveness)
  * Time evolution -- modify branch to produce figure(s) showing time-evolution of "vaccine effectiveness"
  * Explain to general audience -- modify README.md to present results for someone coming to repo (e.g., penguins repo)
  * Reproducibility -- document reproducibility for that audience
  * Pull request -- communicate with collaborators about proposed modifications to main
* Discuss all the submissions
  * [my notes](../grades/README.md)
