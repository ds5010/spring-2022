# 06-Seaborn

* Evaluating pull requests in project repo
* Documenting projects for reproducibility and general usage
* Customizing Seaborn (and Matplotlib)

## Project update

* Ongoing discussions about Maine Connectivity project
* [Maine Connectivity Authority](https://www.maineconnectivity.org/)
* [ConnectMaine](https://www.maine.gov/connectme/about/staff)

## Vaccine-effectiveness case study (cont.)

* [Assignment 05](./assignment05.md) lays out requirements (rubric) for each branch (2 points each)...
  * Scatterplot -- reproduce final scatterplot created in class (arguably demonstrates vaccine effectiveness)
  * Time evolution -- modify branch to produce figure(s) showing time-evolution of "vaccine effectiveness"
  * Explain to general audience -- modify README.md to present results for someone coming to repo (e.g., penguins repo)
  * Reproducibility -- document reproducibility for that audience
  * Pull request -- communicate with collaborators about proposed modifications to main
* Discuss all the submissions
  * [my notes](../grades/README.md)

## Stopped here

* [issues.md](./issues.md)
  * decide what goes into issues
  * decide how to organize the repository
* [my_vaccines repo](https://github.com/pbogden/my_vaccines/tree/my_dev/example)
  * compare "my_dev" to "example" in the main branch
  * includes most of the things that could go into the main branch of the student repo

## Git

* [git-workflow.md](./git-workflow.md) -- simple example
* [git.md](./git.md) -- cheat sheet
