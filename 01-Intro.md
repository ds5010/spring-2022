## Assignment

* Check Canvas

## Quiz

* No quiz in week 1

## Discussion

Introductions

## Lecture

* Syllabus (in Canvas) -- review the content in detail

## Student responsibilities

* python -- the latest release installed locally (recommend anaconda)
* editor -- recommend vscode, atom or others (e.g., vim)
* REPL -- make sure you can run REPL (read-eval-print-loop) from the command line

## Git & github

* The first assignment is a github-classroom tutorial
* Practice with github, markdown, command-line...

## In-class exercise -- I

* Verify that students can access their github accounts
* Demonstrate how to clone their gh-classroom repo, modify a file and submit an assignment (on Canvas)
* Asking questions via github
* Personal and private repos
* github tutorials
  * hands on to verify that each student has basic capabilities

### Colab

* Colab -- https://colab.research.google.com/
  * Colab is Jupyter as a service, with GUI improvements & GPU access (and an underlying business model)
  * Authenticate with your husky.neu.edu
  * Colab and jupyter are for prototyping and in-class exercises, but NOT for code submission.
  * You can share Jupyter notebooks, but editing is not synchronous.  You need to "save" explicitly.

## Homework assignment -- I

* An assignment has been created in github classroom -- check canvas for the URL
  * these are individual assignments -- you should have your own private github repo for the assignment
  * student must set it up so that they will run the code and post the result (maybe hardware & os with versions?)
