* Git and Github
* File I/O and plotting with basic data structures

## Assignment

* I created an assignment in github classroom that uses the github-starter-course
* In Canvas, you'll find the following guidance...
```
Here's the link to the first assignment: https://classroom.github.com/a/XpPg3lCC

* Create your own README.md with markdown.
* Practice syncing your repo with content on your computer.
* Add some feedback to the pull request.
* When you're finished, submit a link to your repo.
```

## Reading (for next week)

* [McKinney, Chapter 1: Preliminaries](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/python-for-data/9781098104023/ch01.html)
* [McKinney, Chapter 2: Python Language Basics](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/python-for-data/9781098104023/ch01.html)
* [How to ask a good question](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask) -- stackoverflow.com
* Github
  * Read the tutorial (in the assignment)
  * [Pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests) -- github.com
    * Commit changes to a project when you want to update things that you've worked on elsewhere.
    * If you're collaborating with others, use pull requests to communicate with project members before merging changes.
    * Commit changes to a project and use pull requests to collaborate/communicate with project members
  * [Introduction to licenses](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/licenses) -- observablehq.com
    * Feusing published work, attribution, copyright
    * [Northeastern's academic integrity policy](https://osccr.sites.northeastern.edu/academic-integrity-policy/)
    * Copy and paste could have legal implications that extend beyond academic integrity (unlikely for us right now).

## Lecture

* Syllabus (in Canvas) -- review the content in detail

## Student responsibilities

* python -- the latest release installed locally (recommend anaconda)
* editor -- recommend vscode, atom or others (e.g., vim)
* REPL -- make sure you can run REPL (read-eval-print-loop) from the command line

## In-class exercise -- github intro

* Verify that students can access their github accounts
* Demonstrate how to clone their gh-classroom repo, modify a file and submit an assignment (on Canvas)
* Asking questions via github
* Personal and private repos
* github tutorials
  * hands on to verify that each student has basic capabilities

## In-class exercise -- colab intro

* Colab -- https://colab.research.google.com/
  * Colab is Jupyter as a service, with GUI improvements & GPU access (and an underlying business model)
  * Authenticate with your husky.neu.edu
  * Colab and jupyter are for prototyping and in-class exercises, but NOT for code submission.
  * You can share Jupyter notebooks, but editing is not synchronous.  You need to "save" explicitly.
* Verify that students can access their github accounts
  * Show how to "share" a notebook with someone else
  * Practice with markdown and tex
* Accessing the iris dataset
  * Look here: https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/blob/master/iris.csv
  * Use the "raw" link
  * `!curl -O "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/iris.csv"
