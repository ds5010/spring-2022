# 5010 Assignment due Feb 22

* In your branch of the vaccines repo:
  * Create a program based the Colab notebook we developed in class that produces the final scatterplot in that notebook.
  * Modify code in your branch to produce figure(s) that demonstrate the time-evolution of vaccine effectiveness.
  * Modify the README.md in your branch to present these results for a general audience (in the spirit of the results shown in the [Palmer Penguins repo](https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins)).
  * Include documentation that makes it clear to that audience how to reproduce those results.
* Create a pull request that documents what you did and proposes these modifications as an update to the main branch
  * Don't merge anything to the main branch.
  * We'll discuss the pull requests next Wednesday and decide how to proceed at that point.
