# 08-Earthquakes

## Quiz

* unittest and classes

## Project

* Update on discussions with Andrew Butcher
* We have a story and some data
* Now we can figure out what to do with them

## Collaborative assignment (Due 22 Mar)

* Create the gh-pages version
* Add this result [bridget_dev_final](https://github.com/ds5010/vaccines/tree/bridget_dev_final)
  * Make as few changes to the dataflow as possible
  * Implement a DRY strategy
  * Add unittests...?
  * Improve modularity...?
* Improve visualization of time
  * For example: [Bar Chart Race, Explained](https://observablehq.com/@d3/bar-chart-race-explained)

## Scope

* First question in the quiz refers to "local", "global" and "nonlocal" keywords
* The example is here: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#private-variables
  * A question came up in class regarding use of the "nonlocal" keyword
  * In response to the question -- try commenting the line `spam = "test spam"`
  * After commenting that line, the line `nonlocal spam` throws "SyntaxError: no binding for nonlocal 'spam' found"
* https://peps.python.org/pep-3104
  * the proposal addresses a shortcoming in ability to access names in outer scope
  * describes the historical issue that gave rise to the "nonlocal" keyword
  * includes comparison with other languages (JavaScript, Perl, Ruby, C, C#, etc.)

## GeoPandas

* notebook: [geopandas.ipynb](./notebooks/geopandas.ipynb)
* [Introduction](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/getting_started/introduction.html)
  * Getting started docs have some simple examples
* [Interactive mapping](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/docs/user_guide/interactive_mapping.html) in User Guide -- geopandas.org
  * [Needs latest folium](https://github.com/geopandas/geopandas/issues/2187)
    * Throws an error in Colab
    * Google helps you find the solution in the github issues!
    * Google the error message and add "geopandas"

## Unit testing

* [unittest.md](./unittest.md)
* [my_vaccines](https://github.com/pbogden/my_vaccines)
* TODO: Scope out roles and responsibilities for the collaborative assignment (above)
