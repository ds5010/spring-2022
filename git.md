# git

Updating a repository from the command-line.

  * if you're on a Mac, "git" should already be installed

## Branches

* Branches allow you to develop outside of "main" (the main branch).
* Branches are good for experimenting and/or collaborating.
* Note: in the old days (last year), "main" was called "master"; you'll see docs refer to "master" instead of "main".

 | command | action |
 | ---     | ---    |
 | `git branch` | List and highlight the current branch (and any others you're working on) |
 | `git branch -a` | List **all** the branches (even those you're not working on) |
 | `git branch newb` | Create a new branch called "newb" (from whatever branch you're in) |
 | `git checkout demo` | Switch to the branch called "demo" (you'll get a "filespec" error if "demo" doesn't exist) |
 | `git branch -d newb` | Delete the "newb" branch (after merging any commits) |
 | `git branch -D newb` | Delete the "newb" branch (discarding any unmerged commits) |

## Changes

 | command | action |
 | ---     | ---    |
 | `git diff` | Show changes in commits between current branch and origin |
 | `git diff --name-status main` | List files that changed between current branch and main |
 | `git diff --name-status firstbranch..newb` | Compare "firstbranch" with newb |
 | `git diff main...newb` | Report differences between the "newb" branch and main (changes that have been committed) |
 | `git diff newb main -- README.md` | Report differences for README.md only
 | `git log` | List commit history (these include the hashes that uniquely identify each commit)
 | `git merge-base main newb` | Get point where the "newb" branch was created from the main (or best common ancestor)

## Commits

After you make a change in to your local repository, you commit the changes and add a message

```
$ git commit . -m "I made a small but super-important change to such and such."
```
To check the status of current repo
```
$ git status
```
To review the commit history
```
$ git log 
```
To checkout a previous commit
```
$ get checkout <tag/branch/commit id>
```
To reset to a previous commit (and lose everything since then!)
```
$ get reset --hard <tag/branch/commit id>
```

## Branches

* `$ git checkout demo`
  * switch to the demo branch
* You need to specify the upstream for the branch before you can "push" or "pull"
* We're not going to be using the workflow for branches, at least not now.
* To merge a branch
  ```
  $ git commit . -m "I made a such-and-such a change"
  $ git checkout main
  $ git merge demo
  ```
* To delete a branch after merging
  * `$ git branch -d branch`
* To delete a branch without merging
  * `$ git branch -D branch`

## Update repository

You update the repository by "pushing to origin". This is okay if you're the only one working on the project.

```
$ git push origin main
```
If you've made a change, then you need first to commit
```
$ git commit . -m "I've made a such-and-such a change"  
$ git push origin main
```
