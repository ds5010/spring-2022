* [My Zoomable Raster & Vector II](https://observablehq.com/d/88a8d31c7bc2f92d)
* [brushable-map](notebooks/brushable-map.ipynb)
* [geojson](https://github.com/ds5010/broadband/blob/main/county/Androscoggin.geojson) on github
  * the github map uses mapbox services
  * mapbox started out as leaflet and became mapbox-gl-js
  * when mapbox went closed source (at version 2.0), the project forked to become [maplibre](https://maplibre.org/)
  * these maps use both vector and raster tile services
